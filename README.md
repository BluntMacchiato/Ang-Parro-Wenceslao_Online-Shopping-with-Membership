### Abstract
- Abstract Data Structure such as the Array List (static), Linked List (dynamic), Queue, Stacks, Graph were the topics discussed and implemented in the Data Structures and Algorithms (DATASAL) and its corresponding laboratory class (LBYCP12). This documentation tackles the primary functions of the app and on how the different lessons taught in class.

### I.            INTRODUCTION

>	In this project activity, student are tasked to implement all of the things they have learned from the course of DATASAL and LBYCP12. With this knowledge, programs such as Breakout, Hangman, Yahtzee, and many others, to name a few, can be implemented with the use of the Java language. Having learned the different data structures, one can already implement and create a new program based here.


### II.            TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY
 
>	In terms of designing the program, it’s flow was not entirely difficult as theSHOP consists of a number of pages to serve its customers. The Home, Store, Account Profile, About, and Search pages are all accessible from a neatly placed menu on the top portion of the program window. It was a matter of listening for cues from the act of pressing the buttons in order to call for the pages’ display.

>	In doing the basic user interface, the group struggled in implementing the JPanel to the canvas since the codes weren’t compatible or in other words, full of errors. Instead of using the basic acm graphics, we decided to use JPanels in everything to make it work seamlessly with the other functions of the main Java application. By doing so, we were able to implement all although we still encountered errors on the way.

>	For the login system, what the group has used is SQL. It was used to store the data of the user for future access. The login system was implement using JFrames connecting to the JPanel for the GUI of the shop.

 ### III.            DIVISION OF TASKS
 
>The project was divided into multiple tasks: designing the program flow, GUI layout, the actual implementation of the ADTs, the actual program to run everything seamlessly, to name a few. All of the tasks were divided and distributed equally among the group.

 ### V.            CONCLUSION
 
>After performing and doing the project, we were able to accomplish building our application with its corresponding graphic user interface, using SQL for the database and at least one of the ADTs from the lecture and laboratory class. The project showcased the students ability to program in Java language and incorporate various methods on how the functions should work, be implemented, and be used.

 ### VI.            ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

>Firstly, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to our professor, Mr. Melvin Cabatuan for his continuous support, his patience, his motivation and immense knowledge of the course. We could not have imagined having a better professor for our course, Data Structures and Algorithms (DATASAL).
 
>We, also, would like to thank our fellow classmates and friends for their help and guidance they’ve given us so that we could all pass this course and also for the fun things we’ve been through during the course of this term.

>Lastly but not the least, we would like to thank our parents and family for their continued support all throughout.
